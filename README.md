# Full-Stack-Part1

It is just a practice code for backend for the beginners to understand how we can use express (an http server) to connect it wirh our frontend.
This is a forked file from Harkirat's repo.
If you also want to get started with backend then you can also try Harkirat's MERN Stack series on youtube and can also fork his repos to work upon.
Have a nice future ahead.
